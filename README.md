# Donation Campaign

## Project Features

- The header has a static navbar section that the user will see when navigating to any page.
- A form is placed on the banner so that the user can find the preferred donation category through search.
- Click on the donation card on the home page to view the details of the donation category on the details page.
- when the user clicks on the donation button on the donation card details page, the card will be added to the donation page.
- If more than 4 cards are added to the donation page, a button called Show All will appear, so that if you click it, you can see all the donation cards.

- The statistics page shows a summary of your donations and total donations in a pie chart.
